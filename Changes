Changes
=======

v2 has many incompatibilities with v1. To see the full list of differences between
v1 and v2, please read the Changes-v2.md file (https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/blob/develop/v2/Changes-v2.md)

v2.0.0 - 24 Apr 2022
  * This i the first v2 release, which represents a set of design changes
    that were learnt over the previous 2 years. As a result the v2 API
    should be much more consistent and uniform across packages, and
    should be much more flexible to accomodate real-world needs.
    
    For a complete list of changes, please see the Changes-v2.md file,
    or check the diff at https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/compare/v1...v2

[Miscellaneous]
  * Minor house cleaning on code generation tools

[jwt]
  * `jwt.ErrMissingRequiredClaim()` has been added

v2.0.0-beta2 - 16 Apr 2022
[jwk]
  * Updated `jwk.Set` API and reflected pending changes from v1 which were
    left over. Please see Changes-v2.md file for details.

  * Added `jwk.CachedSet`, a shim over `jwk.Cache` that allows you to
    have to write wrappers around `jwk.Cache` that retrieves a particular
    `jwk.Set` out of it. You can use it to, for example, pass `jwk.CachedSet`
    to a `jws.Verify`

      cache := jwk.NewCache(ctx)
      cache.Register(ctx, jwksURL)
      cachedSet := jwk.NewCachedSet(cache, jwksURL)
      jws.Verify(signed, jws.WithKeySet(cachedSet))

v2.0.0-beta1 - 09 Apr 2022
[Miscellaneous]
  * Renamed Changes.v2 to Changes-v2.md
  * Housecleaning for lint action.
  * While v2 was not affected, ported over equivalent test for #681 to catch
    regressions in the future.
  * Please note that there is no stability guarantees on pre-releases.

v2.0.0-alpha1 - 04 Apr 2022
  * Initial pre-release of v2 line. Please note that there is no stability guarantees
    on pre-releases.
