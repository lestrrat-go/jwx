# Terminology

## Verification

We use the terms "verify" and "verification" to describe the process of ensuring the integrity of the JWT, namely the signature verification.

## Validation

We use the terms "validate" and "validation" to describe the process of checking the contents of a JWT, for example if the values in fields such as "iss", "sub", "aud" match our expected values, and/or if the token has expired.

# Parsing

## Parse a JWT

To parse a JWT in either raw JSON or JWS compact serialization format, use [`jwt.Parse()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/jwt#Parse)

```go
src := []byte{...}
token, _ := jwt.Parse(src)
```

Note that the above form does NOT perform any signature verification, or validation of the JWT token itself.
This just reads the contents of src, and maps it into the token, period.
In order to perform verification/validation, please see the methods described elsewhere in this document, and pass the appropriate option(s).

## Parse a JWT from file

To parsea JWT stored in a file, use [`jwt.ReadFile()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/jwt#ReadFile). [`jwt.ReadFile()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/jwt#ReadFile) accepts the same options as [`jwt.Parse()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/jwt#Parse).

```go
token, _ := jwt.ReadFile(`token.json`)
```

## Parse a JWT from a *http.Request

To parse a JWT stored within a *http.Request object, use [`jwt.ParseRequest()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/jwt#ParseRequest). It by default looks for JWTs stored in the "Authorization" header, but can be configured to look under other headers and within the form fields.

```go
// Looks under "Authorization" header
token, err := jwt.ParseRequest(req)

// Looks under "X-JWT-Token" header
token, err := jwt.ParseRequest(req, jwt.WithHeaderKey("X-JWT-Token")

// Looks under "Authorization" and "X-JWT-Token" headers
token, err := jwt.ParseRequest(req, jwt.WithHeaderKey("Authorization"), jwt.WithFormKey("X-JWT-Token"))

// Looks under "Authorization" header and "access_token" form field
token, err := jwt.ParseRequest(req, jwt.WithFormKey("access_token"))
```

# Programmatically Creating a JWT

## Using `jwt.New`

The most straight

```go
token := jwt.New()
_ = token.Set(name, value)
```

If repeatedly checking for errors in `Set()` sounds like too much trouble, consider using the builder.

## Using the Builder

Since v1.2.12, the `jwt` package comes with a builder, which you can use to initialize a JWT token in (almost) one go:

```go
token, err := jwt.NewBuilder().
  Claim(name1, value1).
  Claim(name2, value2).
  ...
  Build()
```

For known fields, you can use the special methods:

```go
token, err := jwt.NewBuilder().
  IssuedAt(time.Now()).
  Audience("me").
  Issuer("foobar").
  Build()
```

One caveat that you should be aware about is that all calls to set a claim in the builder performs an _overwriting_
operation. For example, specifying `Audience` multiple times will only overwrite the previous value. If you have fields
that require a list of string, you should use `[]string` as the value

```go
// WRONG. The result will be "aud": "bar", not "aud": ["foo", "bar"]
_, _ = jwt.NewBuilder().
  Audience("foo").
  Audience("bar").
  Build

// CORRECT.
_, _ = jwt.NewBuilder().
  Audience([]string{"foo", "bar"}).
  Build()
```

# JWT Verification

## Parse and Verify a JWT (with single key)

To parse a JWT *and* verify that its content matches the signature as described in the JWS message, you need to add some options when calling the [`jwt.Parse()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/jwt#Parse) function. Let's assume the signature was generated using ES256:

```go
src := []byte{...}
token, _ := jwt.Parse(src, jwt.WithVerify(jwa.ES256, key))
```

In the above example, `key` may either be the raw key (i.e. "crypto/ecdsa".PublicKey, "crypto/ecdsa".PrivateKey) or an instance of [`jwk.Key`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/jwk#Key) (i.e. [`jwk.ECDSAPrivateKey`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/jwk#ECDSAPrivateKey), [`jwk.ECDSAPublicKey`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/jwk#ECDSAPublicKey)). The key type must match the algorithm being used.

## Parse and Verify a JWT (with a key set, matching "kid")

To parse a JWT *and* verify that its content matches the signature as described in the JWS message using a [`jwk.Set`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/jwk#Set), you need to add some options when calling the [`jwt.Parse()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/jwt#Parse) function. Let's assume the JWS contains the "kid" header of the key that generated the signature:

```go
src := []byte{...}
token, _ := jwt.Parse(src, jwt.WithKeySet(keyset))
```

Or, if you want to switch which `jwk.Set` to use depending on the contents of the unverified token, you can use the `jwt.WithKeySetProvider` option.

```go
provider := jwt.KeySetProviderFunc(func(tok jwt.Token) (jwk.Set, error) {
  // choose which set you want to use by inspecting tok.
  // Remeber that tok is UNVERIFIED at this point
  ...
  return keyset, nil
})

token, _ := jwt.Parse(src, jwt.WithKeySetProvider(provider))
```

While the above examples will correctly verify the message if the keys in jwk.Set have the "alg" field populated with a proper value, it will promptly return an error if the "alg" field is invalid (e.g. empty).

This is because we default on the side of safety and require the "alg" field of the key to contain the actual algorithm.The general stance that we take when verifying JWTs is that we don't really trust what the values on the JWT (or actually, the JWS message) says, so we don't just use their `alg` value. This is why we require that users specify the `alg` field in the `jwt.WithVerify` option for single keys.

When you using JWKS, one way to overcome this is to explicitly populate the value of "alg" field by hand prior to using the key.

However, we realize this is cumbersome, and sometimes you just don't know what the algorithm used was.

In such cases you can use the `jwt.InferAlgorithmFromKey()` option:

```go
token, _ := jwt.Parse(src, jwt.WithKeySet(keyset), jwt.InferAlgorithmFromKey(true))
```

This will tell `jwx` to use heuristics to deduce the algorithm used. It's a brute-force approach, and does not always provide the best performance, but it will try all possible algorithms available for a given key type until one of them matches. For example, for an RSA key (either raw key or `jwk.Key`) algorithms such as RS256, RS384, RS512, PS256, PS384, and PS512 are tried.

In most cases use of this option would Just Work. However, this type of "try until something works" is not really recommended from a security perspective, and that is why the option is not enabled by default.

## Parse and Verify a JWT (using key specified in "jku")

You can parse JWTs using the JWK Set specified in the`jku` field in the JWS message by telling `jwt.Parse()` to
use `jws.VerifyAuto()` instead of `jws.Verify()`:

```go
token, _ := jwt.Parse(
  src,
  jwt.WithVerifyAuto(true),
  jwt.WithFetchWhitelist(...),
)
```

This feature must be used with extreme caution. Please see the caveats and fine prints
in the documentation for `jws.VerifyAuto()`

# JWT Validation

To validate if the JWT's contents, such as if the JWT contains the proper "iss","sub","aut", etc, or the expiration information and such, use the [`jwt.Validate()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/jwt#Validate) function.

```go
if err := jwt.Validate(token); err != nil {
	return errors.New(`failed to validate token`)
}
```

By default we only check for the time-related components of a token, such as "iat", "exp", and "nbf". To tell [`jwt.Validate()`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/jwt#Validate) to check for other fields, use one of the various [`jwt.ValidateOption`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/jwt#ValidateOption) values.

```go
// Check for token["iss"] == "github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx"
if err := jwt.Validate(token, jwt.WithIssuer(`github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx`)) {
  return errors.New(`failed to validate token`)
}
```

You may also create a custom validator that implements the `jwt.Validator` interface. These validators can be added as an option to `jwt.Validate()` using `jwt.WithValidator()`. Multiple validators can be specified. The error should be of type `jwt.ValidationError`. Use `jwt.NewValidationError` to create an error of appropriate type.

```go
validator := jwt.ValidatorFunc(func(_ context.Context, t jwt.Token) error {
  if time.Now().Month() != 8 {
    return jwt.NewValidationError(errors.New(`tokens are only valid during August!`))
  }
  return nil
})
if err := jwt.Validate(token, jwt.WithValidator(validator)); err != nil {
  ...
}
```

## Detecting error types

If you enable validation during `jwt.Parse()`, you might sometimes want to differentiate between parsing errors and validation errors. To do this, you can use the function `jwt.IsValidationError()`. To further differentiate between specific errors, you can use `errors.Is()`:

```go
token, err := jwt.Parse(src, jwt.WithValidat(true))
if err != nil {
  if jwt.IsValidationError(err) {
    switch {
    case errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenExpired()):
      ...
    case errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrTokenNotYetValid()):
      ...
    case errors.Is(err, jwt.ErrInvalidIssuedAt()):
      ...
    default:
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

# JWT Serialization

## Serialize using JWS

The `jwt` package provides a convenience function `jwt.Sign()` to serialize a token using JWS.

```go
token := jwt.New()
token.Set(jwt.IssuerKey, `github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx`)

serialized, err := jws.Sign(token, algorithm, key)
```

If you need even further customization, consider using the `jws` package directly.

## Serialize using JWE and JWS

The `jwt` package provides a `Serializer` object to allow users to serialize a token using an arbitrary combination of processors. For example, to encrypt a token using JWE, then use JWS to sign it, do the following:

```go
serizlied, err := jwt.NewSerializer().
  Encrypt(keyEncryptionAlgorithm, keyEncryptionKey, contentEncryptionAlgorithm, compression).
  Sign(signatureAlgorithm, signatureKey).
  Serialize(token)
```

If for whatever reason the buil-tin `(jwt.Serializer).Sign()` and `(jwt.Serializer).Encrypt()` do not work for you, you may choose to provider a custom serialization step using `(jwt.Serialize).Step()`

## Serialize the the `aud` field as a single string

When you marshal `jwt.Token` into JSON, by default the `aud` field is serialized as an array of strings. This field may take either a single string or array form, but apparently there are parsers that do not understand the array form.

The examples below shoud both be valid, but apparently there are systems that do not understand the former ([AWS Cognito has been reported to be one such system](https://github.com/lestrrat-go/jwx/issues/368)).

```
{
  "aud": ["foo"],
  ...
}
```

```
{
  "aud": "foo",
  ...
}
```

To workaround these problematic parsers, you may use the `jwt.Settings()` function with the `jwt.WithFlattenAudience(true)` option.

```go
func init() {
  jwt.Settings(jwt.WithFlattenAudience(true))
}
```

The above call will force all calls to marshal JWT tokens to flatten the `aud` field when it can. This has global effect.
