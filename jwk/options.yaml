      CacheOption is a type of Option that can be passed to the
      `jwk.Cache` object.

      FetchOption is a type of Option that can be passed to `jwk.Fetch()`
      FetchOption also implements the `CacheOption`, and thus can
      safely be passed to `(*jwk.Cache).Configure()`

      ParseOption is a type of Option that can be passed to `jwk.Parse()`
      ParseOption also implmentsthe `ReadFileOption` and `CacheOption`,
      and thus safely be passed to `jwk.ReadFile` and `(*jwk.Cache).Configure()`

      ReadFileOption is a type of `Option` that can be passed to `jwk.ReadFile`

      RegisterOption desribes options that can be passed to `(jwk.Cache).Register()`
options:
  - ident: HTTPClient
    interface: FetchOption
    argument_type: HTTPClient
    comment: |
      WithHTTPClient allows users to specify the "net/http".Client object that
      is used when fetching jwk.Set objects.
  - ident: ThumbprintHash
    interface: AssignKeyIDOption
    argument_type: crypto.Hash
  - ident: RefreshInterval
    interface: RegisterOption
    argument_type: time.Duration
    comment: |
      WithRefreshInterval specifies the static interval between refreshes
      of jwk.Set objects controlled by jwk.Cache.
      
      Providing this option overrides the adaptive token refreshing based
      on Cache-Control/Expires header (and jwk.WithMinRefreshInterval),
      and refreshes will *always* happen in this interval.
  - ident: MinRefreshInterval
    interface: RegisterOption
    argument_type: time.Duration
    comment: |
      WithMinRefreshInterval specifies the minimum refresh interval to be used
      when using `jwk.Cache`. This value is ONLY used if you did not specify
      a user-supplied static refresh interval via `WithRefreshInterval`.
      
      This value is used as a fallback value when tokens are refreshed.
      
      When we fetch the key from a remote URL, we first look at the max-age
      directive from Cache-Control response header. If this value is present,
      we compare the max-age value and the value specified by this option
      and take the larger one.
      
      Next we check for the Expires header, and similarly if the header is
      present, we compare it against the value specified by this option,
      and take the larger one.
      
      Finally, if neither of the above headers are present, we use the
      value specified by this option as the next refresh timing
      
      If unspecified, the minimum refresh interval is 1 hour
  - ident: LocalRegistry

    interface: ParseOption
    argument_type: '*json.Registry'
    comment: This option is only available for internal code. Users don't get to play with it
  - ident: PEM
    interface: ParseOption
    argument_type: bool
    comment: WithPEM specifies that the input to `Parse()` is a PEM encoded key.
  - ident: FetchWhitelist
    interface: FetchOption
    argument_type: Whitelist
    comment: |
      WithFetchWhitelist specifies the Whitelist object to use when
      fetching JWKs from a remote source. This option can be passed
      to both `jwk.Fetch()`, `jwk.NewCache()`, and `(*jwk.Cache).Configure()`
  - ident: IgnoreParseError
    interface: ParseOption
    argument_type: bool
    comment: |
      WithIgnoreParseError is only applicable when used with `jwk.Parse()`
      (i.e. to parse JWK sets). If passed to `jwk.ParseKey()`, the function
      will return an error no matter what the input is.
      
      DO NOT USE WITHOUT EXHAUSTING ALL OTHER ROUTES FIRST.
      
      The option specifies that errors found during parsing of individual
      keys are ignored. For example, if you had keys A, B, C where B is
      invalid (e.g. it does not contain the required fields), then the
      resulting JWKS will contain keys A and C only.
      
      This options exists as an escape hatch for those times when a
      key in a JWKS that is irrelevant for your use case is causing
      your JWKS parsing to fail, and you want to get to the rest of the
      keys in the JWKS.
      
      Again, DO NOT USE unless you have exhausted all other routes.
      When you use this option, you will not be able to tell if you are
      using a faulty JWKS, except for when there are JSON syntax errors.
  - ident: FS
    interface: ReadFileOption
    argument_type: fs.FS
    comment: |
      WithFS specifies the source `fs.FS` object to read the file from.
  - ident: PostFetcher
    interface: RegisterOption
    argument_type: PostFetcher
    comment: |
      WithPostFetcher specifies the PostFetcher object to be used on the
      jwk.Set object obtained in `jwk.Cache`. This option can be used
      to, for example, modify the jwk.Set to give it key IDs or algorithm
      names after it has been fetched and parsed, but before it is cached.
  - ident: RefreshWindow
    interface: CacheOption
    argument_type: time.Duration
    comment: |
      WithRefreshWindow specifies the interval between checks for refreshes.

      See the documentation in `httprc.WithRefreshWindow` for more details.
  - ident: ErrSink
    interface: CacheOption
    argument_type: ErrSink
    comment: |
      WithErrSink specifies the `httprc.ErrSink` object that handles errors
      that occurred during the cache's execution.

      See the documentation in `httprc.WithErrSink` for more details.
